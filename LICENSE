The reason I have chosen MIT License

The MIT License offers broad permissions for code usage, fostering collaboration. 
Its simplicity aids clarity, unlike more complex licenses. Unlike the viral GPL, it doesn't 
compel open-sourcing entire projects, making it appealing for businesses. It's compatible
 with various licenses, easing integration. Widely adopted by major projects like jQuery 
and Ruby on Rails, it strikes a balance between freedom and simplicity, appealing to both 
individuals and organizations.
